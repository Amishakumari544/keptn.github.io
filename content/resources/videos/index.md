| **Continuously evaluating application resiliency with LitmusChaos, Locust and Keptn** with Adrian Gonciarz, Kitopi <br><br> Adrian Gonciarz is sharing the journey of Kitopi on how they implemented application resiliency evaluation with LitmusChaos, Locust, GitLab, and Keptn. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_RVxVQQrHo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
| **Keptn Quality Gates with Argo and Jenkins for Distributed Load Testing – Lessons Learned from Intuit** with Sumit Nagal, Intuit<br><br>In this Keptn User Group we have Sumit Nagal who leads the Reliability Engineering Team at Intuit. In his latest blog he gave insights into why and how his team provides Distributed Load Testing using Argo in Kubernetes (DISTRO) to his organization. We will learn how they integrated Keptn Quality Gates to automate performance test analysis for every tested microservices. He will discuss the challenges and their solutions for dynamic environments, dynamic SLIs and SLOs and dynamic work loads. Join this User Group as the goal is to not only hear from Sumit but also engage in an active discussion about how Keptn might also help you with your challenges. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Omprl5OFtEw?start=402" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

| **Automating Quality Gates in Azure DevOps with Keptn** with Bert van der Heyden, RealDolmen<br><br> Azure DevOps is a popular choice for many organizations to automate continuous delivery of enterprise and cloud native applications. In this Keptn webinar we have Bert Van der Heyden, Performance Engineer at RealDolmen and creator of the Azure DevOps Keptn Extensions, walking us through the use case of integrating Keptn's SLI/SLO-based Quality Gates into Azure DevOps pipelines in order to automate the build validation and approval process. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgCizWLVsPc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
| **Evaluating the resiliency of your microservices with LitmusChaos tests and Keptn** with Karthik S, LitmusChaos<br><br> Chaos Engineering is the new entrant into the delivery pipeline of cloud-native applications, and a proven means of ascertaining SLO compliance and evaluating the resilience of applications. This assumes even more importance given the en-masse migration that organizations are making to Kubernetes as the development & deployment platform of choice. LitmusChaos is a cloud-native chaos engineering framework that provides a rich suite of chaos experiments and the ability to orchestrate chaos as defined by the principles of chaos. In this webinar, we will view how Keptn's litmus service triggers chaos on applications under load as part of its powerful automated CD pipeline, thereby evaluating application resilience and strengthening the quality gate evaluation process. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aa5SzQmv4EQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

| **Manage Keptn with a Slackbot** with Nestor Zapata and Zohaib Ul-Hassan, Citrix<br><br> Learn how to use our Slackbot to get answers from Keptn and also to trigger tests and quality gate evaluation with all results directly delivered to Slack! No need to ever leave one of your favorite tools again. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uJkwapoDuo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
| **Keptn-in-a-box - delivering the Autonomous Cloud out of the box** with Sergio Hinojosa, Dynatrace<br><br> Keptn-In-A-Box is part of the automation for delivering Autonomous Cloud Workshops with Dynatrace. This is not a tutorial but more an explanation of what the shell file set up for you on a plain Ubuntu image. A simple Bash script will set-up a fully functional Single Node Kubernetes Cluster with Dynatrace installed and Kubernetes Cluster, Cloud Applications, and Events monitoring enabled. This script is used as userdata when spinning up elastic compute images (ec2) in amazon web services, but it can run also manually in a Linux machine or VM with snap installed. The tested distro is Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS For spinning up instances automatically with AWS completely configured and set up, and also automating the creation and management of Dynatrace environments. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9ZYdih0anE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |

| **Scaling Event Driven Delivery & Operations with Keptn** with Andi Grabner<br><br> We broke monoliths into microservices and leverage events to orchestrate business processes across all moving pieces. Why are not applying the same event-driven concept to delivery and operations automation? This session introduces the CNCF project Keptn (www.keptn.sh): An Event-Driven Control Plane for automating Continuous Delivery, SLO-Based Quality Gates, SRE Automation and Auto-Remediation. Besides an intro to event-driven CD & CO you will see live demos + how the community is adopting Keptn as well as how you can extend and contribute. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OpyoXgCAzA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>|
| **Overcoming scalability issues in your Prometheus ecosystem** - Talk at Cloud Native Night Munich with Jürgen Etzlstorfer<br><br> Prometheus is considered a foundational building block when running applications on Kubernetes and has become the de-facto open-source standard for visibility and monitoring in Kubernetes environments. Your first starting points when operating Prometheus are most probably configuring scraping to pull your metrics from your services, building dashboards on top of your data with Grafana, or defining alerts for important metrics breaching thresholds in your production environment. in your production environment. As soon as you are comfortable with Prometheus as your weapon of choice, your next challenges will be scaling and managing Prometheus for your whole fleet of applications and environments. As the journey “From Zero to Prometheus Hero” is not trivial you will find obstacles on the way. In this presentation, we are highlighting the most common challenges we have seen and provide guidance on how to overcome them. Finally, we are discussing a solution to get you there more quickly to build automated, future-proof observability with Prometheus showing Keptn as one possible implementation. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbAp5YuPjZI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
