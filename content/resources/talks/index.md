| **Putting Chaos into Continuous Delivery - how to increase the resilience of your applications** with Jürgen Etzlstorfer<br><br>We will discuss how you can construct continuous delivery pipelines that include chaos experimentation while simulating real-world load to test the resilience of applications. On top, we implement quality gates based on SLOs to ensure resilient applications are deployed into production. Continuous Delivery practices have evolved significantly with the cloud-native paradigm. GitOps & Chaos Engineering are at the forefront of this new CD approach, with an ever-increasing pattern involving Git-backed pipeline definitions that implement “chaos stages” in pre-prod environments to gauge SLO compliance. In this talk, we will discuss how you can construct pipelines that include chaos experimentation (mapped to declarative hypothesis around application steady-state) while simulating real-world load and implement quality gates to ensure resilient applications are deployed into production. All this - in a GitOps native manner. We will also demonstrate how you can include chaos tests to your existing CD pipelines without the need of rewriting them. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7THMrIGKO4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
| **Scaling Event Driven Delivery & Operations with Keptn** with Andi Grabner<br><br> We broke monoliths into microservices and leverage events to orchestrate business processes across all moving pieces. Why are not applying the same event-driven concept to delivery and operations automation? This session introduces the CNCF project Keptn: An Event-Driven Control Plane for automating Continuous Delivery, SLO-Based Quality Gates, SRE Automation and Auto-Remediation. Besides an intro to event-driven CD & CO you will see live demos + how the community is adopting Keptn as well as how you can extend and contribute. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OpyoXgCAzA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>|
| **Overcoming scalability issues in your Prometheus ecosystem** - Talk at Cloud Native Night Munich with Jürgen Etzlstorfer<br><br> Prometheus is considered a foundational building block when running applications on Kubernetes and has become the de-facto open-source standard for visibility and monitoring in Kubernetes environments. Your first starting points when operating Prometheus are most probably configuring scraping to pull your metrics from your services, building dashboards on top of your data with Grafana, or defining alerts for important metrics breaching thresholds in your production environment. in your production environment. As soon as you are comfortable with Prometheus as your weapon of choice, your next challenges will be scaling and managing Prometheus for your whole fleet of applications and environments. As the journey “From Zero to Prometheus Hero” is not trivial you will find obstacles on the way. In this presentation, we are highlighting the most common challenges we have seen and provide guidance on how to overcome them. Finally, we are discussing a solution to get you there more quickly to build automated, future-proof observability with Prometheus showing Keptn as one possible implementation. | <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbAp5YuPjZI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
