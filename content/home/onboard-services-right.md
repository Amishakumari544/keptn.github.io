Your service will be onboarded automatically. Keptn will create the proper Helm charts and Istio configuration behind the scenes. All configuration is stored GitOps-style in a Git repository, which you can link to any upstream repository.

```console
keptn onboard service carts
--project=sockshop --chart=./carts
```
